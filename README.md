# What is does
Search for repositories on github (keywords in title and description) and sorts the result depending on amunt of stars of the repo. The is as well implemented infintie load. 
It saves the searches in the local storage and displayes them in the History tab (with option to delete searches)

//TODO: Infitite load does work only on mac, implement it so that it works on linux too. 

# Interesting parts 

I have addes the less css by ecjecting the project and adding fitting loaders. Die benefts of using the less css, are visible in reusable elements (see implementation of a button component).
